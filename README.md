# Academic Mastery Study
A CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR THE SPRINGBOARD DATA SCIENCE INTENSIVE
***

## SUMMARY
Students taking advantage of practice exercises through various software applications seek an evaluation of their preparedness for formal academic assessments. Students tend to quit an application if it is too boring or give up if the questions are too challenging. They would like an an accurate evaluation of any gaps in knowledge and skills without sitting through an assessment that repeatedly tests established proficiencies and difficulties.

This study aims to improve academic evaluations by predicting whether a student will answer the next test question correctly. The project examines data from students preparing for three tests: the GMAT, SAT and ACT. Question fields in the dataset indicate outcome, group (test for which the student is preparing), track (test subject), sub-track, topics, question format, and times for when the question was started and answered or deactivated (timed-out). The study investigates relationships that could predict observations under the field labeled ‘correct’.

The goal is to help test developers build an application that precisely evaluates competencies so that fewer demonstrations of proficiency can accurately determine mastery.

## APPROACH
1. [**Data Wrangling & Initial Exploration**](/notebooks/initial_data_exploration.ipynb): Download the `grockit_all_data.zip` data file from the Grockit competition on Kaggle, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/WhatDoYouKnow/data. Employ Python technologies to import and inspect the raw `training.csv` data, isolate relevant variables, organize the dataframe, and rectify duplicate, missing, invalid or corrupted values. Begin creating data visualizations to inspect variables and analyze outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Inferential Statistics**: Continue with data visualization, using plots to gain insights, look for correlations, consider a hypothesis to explore, then leverage statistical inference to test the hypothesis.

3. **Machine Learning**: Apply (to-be-determined) machine learning algorithms, evaluating the performance of each, and decide on the right one to use for this study.
